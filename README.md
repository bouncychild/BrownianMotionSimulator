# Brownian Motion Simulation

A Python implementation for simulating and visualizing standard and generalized Brownian motion paths, based on methods from Paul Glasserman's *Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering*.

## Features

- Simulates both standard (μ=0, σ=1) and generalized Brownian motion paths
- Vectorized implementation for efficient computation
- Visualizations of:
  - Sample paths over time
  - Terminal value distributions
- Statistical analysis of simulated paths
- Configurable parameters for:
  - Number of paths
  - Time resolution
  - Drift and volatility
  - Random seed

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brownian-motion-simulation.git
